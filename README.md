The "Quality Assurance of 3D Printed Parts Using A.I." project develops an innovative quality assurance system for 3D printed components. It employs AI algorithms to ensure dimensional accuracy and structural integrity, integrating real-time monitoring to identify defects like warping and voids. This automated approach enhances manufacturing efficiency and optimizes quality control processes.
